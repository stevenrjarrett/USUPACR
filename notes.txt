Notes for thresholding the distance values:
- otsu thresholding: http://www.labbookpages.co.uk/software/imgProc/otsuThreshold.html
- applying the threshold in opencv: http://answers.opencv.org/question/42204/converting-image-from-grayscale-to-binary/
- Idea: use the expected distance of the person and set an upper and lower bound.
